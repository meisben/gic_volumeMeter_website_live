## Learning outcomes (Whole activity)

| Learning outcome | Detail                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wind Turbines    | Learn about how wind turbines work                                            |
| CAD              | Design our own wind turibine blade                                            |
| 3D printing      | 3D print our wind turbine blade                                               |
| Electronics      | Learn how to (a) use a multimeter and (b) create and use a voltage divider    |
| Coding           | Automatically measure the voltage of a wind turbine using a microcontroller   |
| Radio waves      | Radio broadcast our measurement to a seperate microcontroller across the room |
| Experiment       | Test the wind turbine blades we designed                                      |

# What is the purpose of a wind turbine?

We'll use this video as an educational aid. 
And if you're reading this outside a workshop, well, this video does a great job of introducing the topic.

>**Questions (let's discuss together)**
>* *Why do we build wind turbines?*
>* *Do wind turbines always face the same direction?*
>* *Why are wind turbines tall?*
>* *What types of engineering are involved in wind turbines?*
