# Introduction

## Aims
In this part of the activity we will:
* How can we measure the performance of the wind turbine?
* Measure the maximum voltage generated by the wind turinbe
* Compare how this measured voltage changes with rotor velocity
* Discuss how we can record this automatically

## Learning outcomes

# Measuring the performance of the wind turbine

## Purpose of a wind turbine

If you recall from the video shared right at the beginning of this workshop, the main purpose of a wind turbine is to efficiently rotate and generate electricity.

```goat
   .------------------------------.      .----------.      .---------------------.  
   | Potential energy of the wind +----->| Rotation +----->|Generate electricity |
   '------------------------------'      '----------'      '---------------------' 
```

>**Question (let's discuss together)**
>* *How can we measure the performance of the wind turbine?*

{{< details "**☑️ Some possible answers**" >}}
* We could count the number of times the blade rotates in a second, or in a minute
* We could mesaure how much electricity is generated
{{< /details >}}

## Measuring the voltage

One way of measuring how much electricity is generated by the turbine is to measure the voltage.

Let's do that now with our wind turbine

### Attach a crocodile connector to each side of the motor terminal.
Make sure to note which terminal is postive (+ve) and negative (-ve)

### Connect the end of crocodile lead into the electrical connector

### Connect the positive and negative probes of the multimeter into the corresponding electrical connectors

### Set the multimeter to measure DC voltage (Autorange)

### Spin the wind turbine and observe what is the voltage output
* Spin the turbine with your hand or put in it front of a fan
* If the value is negative swap the -ve and +ve probes around
