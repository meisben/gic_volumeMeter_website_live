# What we're going to make

The first wind turbine we built was great, but it was also a bit limited. 

We want to add a microcontroller to it. Our aim is to automatically measure it's speed with the computer.

To do that we're going to have to make some more space to attach and electronic circuit and a microcontroller.

We're going to do this by hacking the original kit.

The custom wind turbine we're giong to make is shown below (click the play button to show the model)

# Hardware changes

## Dissasembly of the mind wind turbine

### Remove the blades and rotor from the wind turbine

### Remove the M4 screws and nuts

The M4 screws (4mm in diameter) are the largest screws. Remove all 5 of these, and the corresponding nuts from the assembly. 

Place them carefully back into the bag they came in

## Assembly of the custom wind turbine

### Make sure you've got all of the correct parts

### Assembly

Assemble the parts together with a screwdriver (Phillips) as shown

### Almost finished assembly

You should end up with a part that looks like this!

### Finished assembly

Add the microbit holder to complete it (if not already attached)

Be careful with it (it clips into the assembly)
