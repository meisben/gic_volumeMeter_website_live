# Introduction

## Aims
In this part of the activity we will:
* Transmit our recorded voltage as a radio signal using the micro:bit
* Receive our radio signal using a seperate micro:bit
* Plot that value on the computer

# Transmitting the measured voltage as a radio signal

## Using two microbits

We will be using two microbits. 

* **Micro:bit A** will send a radio signal (with the voltage measurement). It is attached to the wind turbine.
* **Micro:bit B** will receive a radio signal (with the voltage measurement). It is attached to your computer.

The radio signal can be transmitted up to 70 meters.

## Programming Micro:bit A

> :elephant: Reminder: **Micro:bit A** will send a radio signal (with the voltage measurement). It is attached to the wind turbine.

Go to [micro:bit make code](https://makecode.microbit.org) and start a new program

Enter this code. You will need to use:
* Pins
* Variables
* Serial
* Radio

> :warning: Pick your own radio group from 0-255. Both micro:bits need to use the same group. It must not be the same as anyone else's in the room.

## Download it to your microbit

You will need to:
* Insert your usb lead
* Connect your device (as shown in the image below)

## Run the program

You should see:
* A big square shown on the microbit display

You can now unplug the micro:bit from the usb lead. 

Connect the battery to the micro:bit. It should show the same image on its display without being connected to the computer

> :satellite: You're now continuously transmitting the voltage value as a radio signal!

# Receiving the measured voltage as a radio signal

## Programming Micro:bit B

> :elephant: Reminder: **Micro:bit B** will receive a radio signal (with the voltage measurement). It is attached to your computer.

Go to [micro:bit make code](https://makecode.microbit.org) and start a new program

Enter this code. You will need to use:
* Serial
* Radio

> :warning: Use the same radio group as for **Micro:bit A**

[![Pic](/images/monitor_wind_turbine_remotely/code_radio_receive_voltage_v2.png)](/images/monitor_wind_turbine_remotely/code_radio_receive_voltage_v2.png)

## Download it to your microbit

You will need to:
* Insert your usb lead
* Connect your device (as shown in the image below)

[![Pic](/images/using_microcontroller_to_monitor_velocity/connect_device_v1.png)](/images/using_microcontroller_to_monitor_velocity/connect_device_v1.png)

## Run the program

Go to *show data - device*

You should see:
* A small square shown on the microbit display
* When you rotate the shaft of the wind turbine clockwise, then **Micro:bit A** reads the analogue input and transmits it to **Micro:bit B** as a radio signal
* **Micro:bit B** transmits this as serial data (along the usb cable) to the computer

> :tada: You're now continuously transmitting and receiving the voltage value as a radio signal!

# Test it with the wind turbine blades

Next steps:

* Install the wind turbine flat blades
* Hold the wind turbine in front of a fan
* Check the voltage value is plotted on a computer when the wind turbine turns
