# Introduction

## Aims
In this part of the activity we will:
* Assemble a wind turbine
* Understand how it generates electricity
* Test it
  * Experiement what factors make it spin faster/slower
  * Understand its limitations

## Learning outcomes

| Learning outcome |                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Potential energy | What powers the turbine                                      |
| Generation       | How the turbine generates electricity                        |
| Gearing          | Why gears connect the turbine and generator (motor)          |
| Efficiency       | Which factors make this simple turbine move faster or slower |

# Assembly

## Instructions

To assemble the wind turbine follow the assembly [instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a_SXCAKlSGLDT8yWWpcA-Sj3j0ReLlv3/view) provided by your mentor. Your mentor will provide these on paper, or you can view them at the link.

# Test

## Test #1 without the blades

1. Remove any blades from the turbine
2. Try and rotate the shaft of the turbine quickly between your finger and thumb. Does the LED light up?
3. Try rotating the other direction. Does the LED light up?


>**Questions (let's discuss together)**
>* *Why does the LED light up?*
>* *Why does the LED light up if you turn the shaft in one direction but not the other direction?*
>* *Why are the gears needed to light the LED?*

## Test #2 with the blades in simulated wind

1. Attach blades to the turbine
2. Place the wind turbine in the airflow of a desk fan
3. Adjust the blades so that the wind turbine rotates (in the direction established in test #1)
4. If you adjust the blades correctly the LED should light up

>**Questions (let's discuss together)**
>* *Does the turbine spin easier in one direction that the other? Why?*
>* *What can you do to make the turbine spin faster?*
>* *What else can you do to make the turbine spin faster?*
