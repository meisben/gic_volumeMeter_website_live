# Introduction

## Aims
In this part of the activity we will:
* Install the flat turbine blades and check the voltage generated by them
* Install the airfoil turbine blades and check the voltage generated by them
* Draw conclusions

## Learning outcomes

| Learning outcome |                                                    |

# Test the wind turbine

## Install the flat blades

## Place the wind turbine in front of the fan

* Record the voltage generated
* Ajust the angle of the blades
* Record the voltage generated
* ... repeat

## Install the airfoil blades

* Record the voltage generated
* Ajust the angle of the blades
* Record the voltage generated
* ... repeat

## Discuss your conclusions with a mentor

* Show a mentor your results and discuss your conclusions
